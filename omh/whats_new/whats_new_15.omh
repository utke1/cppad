$section CppAD Changes and Additions During 2015$$

$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2015
(in reverse order by date).
The purpose of this section is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 01-07$$
The following changes were merged in from the $code color_hes$$ branch:
$list number$$
Specify the type of 
$cref/coloring/sparse_hessian/work/color_method/$$
for the sparse hessian calculations. 
To be specific, instead of $code "cppad"$$ and $code "colpack"$$,
the choices are $code "cppad.symmetric"$$, $code "cppad.general"$$,
and $code "colpack.star"$$.
This is not compatible with the change on 
$cref/01-02/whats_new_15/01-02/$$, which was so recent 
that this should not be a problem.
$lnext
The $cref/n_sweep/link_sparse_hessian/n_sweep/$$ values were
not begin returned properly by
$cref cppad_sparse_hessian.cpp$$ and
$cref adolc_sparse_hessian.cpp$$.
The CppAD version has been fixed and the ADOL-C version
has been set to zero.
$lnext
The $cref link_sparse_hessian$$ example case was to sparse for good
testing (by mistake).
This has been fixed.
$lnext
Add $icode n_sweep$$ to
$cref/link_sparse_hessian/link_sparse_hessian/n_sweep/$$ and
$cref/speed_main/speed_main/Speed Results/n_sweep/$$.
$lnext
Change the $code cppad$$ sparse Hessian
$cref/color_method/sparse_hessian/work/color_method/$$
to take advantage of the symmetry of the Hessian
(in a similar fashion to the $code colpack$$ coloring method).
$lend

$head 01-02$$
Added to option to uses
$cref/colpack/colpack_prefix/$$ for the sparse Hessian
$cref/coloring method/sparse_hessian/work/color_method/$$;
see the example $cref colpack_hes.cpp$$.
